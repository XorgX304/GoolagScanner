<Comment>SalesLogix is the Customer Relationship Management solution thatdrives  sales performance in small to medium-sized businesses through Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support automation and back-office integration.  The problem:  By manipulating the cookies used by the Web Client, it is possible to trick the  server into authenticating a remote user as the CRM administrator without requiring a password.    It is also possible to perform SQL injection attacks on the SQL server that is used as the data store for the SalesLogix CRM system, reveal detailed error reports contained in HTTP headers and disclose the real filesystem paths to various SalesLogix directories.   The SalesLogix server itself is vulnerable to an attack that would allow a malicious user to obtain the username and password used to access the SQL server used as a data store. The disclosed username and password always have read/write permissions on the database.   Another vulnerability in the SalesLogix server allows an unauthenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the server in any directory (s)he chooses.   http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/11450</Comment>

<Query>"Powered by DMXReady Site Chassis Manager" -site:dmxready.com</Query>
<Comment>It is reported that DMXReady Site Chassis Manager is susceptible to two remotely exploitable input validation vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied data. The first issue is an unspecified cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were to be followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.  The second issue is an unspecified SQL injection vulnerability. It may be possible for a remote user to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the underlying database used by the application. This could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic or other attacks.  Successful exploitation could result in compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.</Comment>

<Query>intitle:"osTicket :: Support Ticket System"</Query>
<Comment>osTicket is a widely-used open source support ticket system. It is a lightweight support ticket tool written mainly using PHP scripting language. There are several vulnerabilities in the osTicket software that may allow for an attacker to take control of the affected web server, disclose sensitive data from the database, or read arbitrary files. These issues have been reported to the developers and a new updated version of osTicket is available for download. All affected users should upgrade their osTicket installations immediately. http://www.addict3d.org/index.php?page=viewarticle&amp;amp;type=security&amp;amp;ID=3882 </Comment>

<Comment>Description of Vulnerabilities Multiple vulnerabilities in FlatNuke have been reported, which can be exploited by remote users to trigger denial of service conditions, execute arbitrary PHP code, conduct Cross-Site Scripting attacks and disclose arbitrary images and system information.  If the "/flatnuke/foot_news.php" script is accessed directly a while() call is made that enters an infinite loop, leading to full CPU utilisation.  [..]  User-supplied input passed to the "image" parameter in the "thumb.php" script is not correctly validated. This can be exploited to disclose arbitrary images from external and local resources via directory traversal attacks, or to disclose the installation path.  It is also possible to disclose the system path by accessing certain scripts directly or specially formed parameters.</Comment>

<Comment>This error message highlights potentially unpatched or misconfigured Netscape Application Server or iPlanet application servers. An inquisitive mind would probably want to manually alter the URL's returned by this query, just to see what other, more informative messages might be revealed. As these servers are already exhibiting a misconfiguration, this could lead to other vulnerabilities being discovered. Finally, these servers are running software that is a few years old now. An attacker may feel that because of this, there's a strong possibility that they're not patched-up fully either, making them potentially vulnerable to known exploits.</Comment>

<Comment>These are squid server cache reports. Fairly benign, really except when you consider using them for evil purposes. For example, an institution stands up a proxy server for their internal users to get to the outside world. Then, the internal user surf all over to their hearts content (including intranet pages cuz well, the admins are stupid) Voila, intranet links show up in the external cache report. Want to make matters worse for yourself as an admin? OK, configure your external proxy server as a trusted internal host. Load up your web browser, set your proxy as their proxy and surf your way into their intranet. Not that I've noticed any examples of this in this google list. *COUGH* *COUGH* *COUGH*  unresolved DNS lookups give clues *COUGH* *COUGH* ('scuse me. must be a furball) OK, lets say BEST CASE scenario. Let's say there's not security problems revealed in these logs. Best case scenario is that outsiders can see what your company/agency/workers are surfing. </Comment>

<Comment>Webmasters wanting to exclude search engine robots from certain parts of their site often choose the use of a robot.txt file on the root of the server. This file basicly tells the bot which directories are supposed to be off-limits. An attacker can easily obtain that information by very simply opening that plain text file in his browser. Webmasters should *never* rely on this for real security issues. Google helps the attacker by allowing a search for the "disallow" keyword.</Comment>

<Comment>With Compulive News you can enter the details of your news items onto a webform and upload images through your browser. It integrates seamlessly within your website. When you open your CNU5 zip there is a news folder created with three subfolders: htmlarea, images and admin. In the news folder is your database file â€˜news.mdbâ€™.  For security purposes the manual recommends that you immediately rename this database to a name of your own choosing thereby making it harder for anyone to download your news database.  The database contains the plain text password.   PS: this search is based on the index.of method. There are other ways to find this software, but finding the news database becomes a lot more difficult for an attacker that way.</Comment>

<Comment>File_id.diz is a description file uploaders use to describe packages uploaded to FTP sites. Although rooted in legitimacy, it is used largely by software piracy groups to describe their ill gotten goods. Systems administrators finding file_id.diz in directory listings on their servers may discover their boxes have been hacked and are being used as a distroubtion site for pirated software.  .nfo's often contain info on which piracy group the files have passed through on their way to their final resting place.

It is easy to set up for a beginner, but still easy to customize for the more experienced user.  The built-in login system makes sure that only people with the right username and password gains access to PHPFM, however, you can also choose to disable the login system and use PHPFM for public access.   It can currently: create, rename and delete folders; create, upload, rename, download and delete files; edit text files; view image files; sort files by name, size, permissions and last modification date both ascending and descending; communicate in more languages.   This search finds those "public" versions of PHPFM. An attacker can use them to manage his own files (phpshell anyone ?).  PS: thanks to j0hnny for the public access angle :)</Comment>

<Query>intitle:"PHP Shell *" "Enable stderr" filetype:php</Query>
<Comment>PHP Shell is a shell wrapped in a PHP script. It's a tool you can use to execute arbiritary shell-commands or browse the filesystem on your remote Web server. This replaces, to a degree, a normal telnet-connection. You can use it for administration and maintenance of your Web site using commands like ps, free, du, df, and more. If these shells aren't protected by some form of authentication, an attacker will basicly *own* the server. This search finds such unprotected phpshells by looking for the keyword "enable stderr". </Comment>

<Comment>Microsoft Certificate Services Authority (CA) software can be used to issue digital certificates. These are often used as "proof" that someone or something is what they claim they are.  The Microsoft certificates are meant to be used with IIS for example with Outlook Web Access. The users of these certificates have to decide if they trust it or not. If they do, they can import a root certificate into their browsers (IE).  Anyways, this search by JimmyNeutron uncovers a few of these certificate servers directly connected to the Internet. Which (in theory) means anyone could issue a certificate from these sites and abuse it to mislead websurfers in phishing scams and such.</Comment>

<Comment>Netcraft reports a site's operating system, web server, and netblock owner together with, if available, a graphical view of the time since last reboot for each of the computers serving the site.  So, Netcraft scans Web servers, Google scans Netcraft, and the hacker scans Google.  This search is easily modified (replace "apache" for the other server software), thus adding yet another way to find the webserver software version info. </Comment>

<Comment>Network Query Tool enables any Internet user to scan network information using: * Resolve/Reverse Lookup * Get DNS Records * Whois (Web) * Whois (IP owner) * Check port (!!!) * Ping host * Traceroute to host * Do it all  The author has been informed that the nqt form also accepts input from cross site pages, but he will not fix it.  A smart programmer could use the port scan feature and probe al the nmap services ports. Though this would be slow, but it provides a higher degree of  anonymity, especially if the attacker is using a proxy or an Internet Cafe host to access the NQT pages.  It gets even worse .. an attacker can scan the *internal* hosts of the networks that host NQT in many cases. Very dangerous.  PS: this vulnerability was found early this year (search google for the full report), but was never added to the GHDB for some reason.</Comment>

<Comment>Hit Jammer is a Unix compatible script that allows you to manage the content and traffic exchange and make web changes, all without needing HTML. It is typicaly used by the underground sites on the Net who "pay for surfing ads" and advertise spam services or software. An attacker can find these sites by searching for the typical "powered by hit jammer !" frase on the bottom of the main page. Then if he changes the URL to www.target.com/admin/admin.php he is taken to the admin panel.   Hit Jammer administrators are warned to protect this page with the .htaccess logon procedure, but many fail to do just that. In such cases, customer information like email addresses and passwords are in clear view of the attacker. Since human beings often use one simple password for many things this is a very dangerous practice. </Comment>

<Query>intitle:liveapplet inurl:LvAppl</Query>
<Comment>Canon has a series of netcams that all use the "WebView LiveScope" software. They are frequently used by japanese sites. Unfortunately most are crawled by their IP address so determining their location becomes more difficult. Some model names are: * VB-C10 * VB-101 * VB-C50i  This search looks for the java applet called "LiveApplet" that is used by Canon's network camera feeds. There is also a standalone (free) program, that is easier to control and lets you save bookmarks. It's available for PC and MACs. The win32 download is here: http://www.x-zone.canon.co.jp/cgi-bin/nph-wvh35-cs.cgi</Comment>

<Comment>Toast Forums is an ASP message board on the Internet. Toast Forums also has all the features of an advanced message board (see hxxp://www.toastforums.com/).

After renaming the data.mdb file, open constants.asp and change the tstDBConnectString constant to reflect the new name.  -- end quote --  This search finds sites running Toast Forum by using the LINK: operator. Trial and error is needed to find the database file from the results by changing the URL. Member data can be found in the table "tstdb_Member". It looks like this:  "ID" "FName" "LName" "Username" "Password" "Email" "HideEmail" "ICQ" "Homepage" "Signature" "IP" "Skin" "IncludeSignature" "NotifyDefault" "PostCount" "LastLoginDate" "LastPostDate"  Passwords are encrypted with the RC4 algoritm, so an attacker would find cracking them is (more) difficult (than usual).  </Comment>

<Query>inurl:"nph-proxy.cgi" "Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy"</Query>
<Comment>Observing the web cracker in the wild, one feels like they are watching a bear. Like a bear stocks up on food and then hibernates, a web cracker must stock up on proxies, and then hack until they run out. Web crackers are a distinct breed, and many do not comfort well with the draconian measures that many other crackers take, such as port and service scanning, the modern web cracker finds such tactics much too intrusive. This leaves the web cracker with the only viable option to come in contact with a large number of proxies being to use public proxy lists. These are of course very slow, and very very unstable, and do not allow the cracker much time between his proxy runs.  Luckily google gives them another option, if they are smart enough to find it.  CGI-proxy ( http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ ) is a CGI-based proxy application. It runs on a web server, and acts as an http proxy, in CGI form. A prudent site owner would hide it behind .htaccess, as most do, but with a powerful tool like google, the inprudent few who leave it open can quickly be seperated from the wise masses.  CGI-proxy's default page contains the text, as you can see in the demo on their site:  "Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy by entering a URL below. Only HTTP and FTP URLs are supported. Not all functions will work (e.g. some JavaScript), but most pages will be fine."  The proxy as it resides on a server is most often called nph-proxy.cgi. A web cracker can now use google to enumerate his list of proxy servers, like so:  inurl:"nph-proxy.cgi" "Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy"  More results can be obtained by admitting the "inurl:nph-proxy.cgi" constraint, but much more trash is generated as well.</Comment>

<Comment>Finds websites using YellDL (or also known as YellDownLoad), a download tracker written in PHP. Unfortunately this downloader downloads everything you want to, like its own files too: http://xxxxxxxxxx/download.php?f=../download&amp;e=php  By guessing some could download information which shoudln't get out of the server (think of ../phpMyAdmin/config.php or other stuff - no need to say that lazy people use same passwords for their DB- and FTP-login.  Another search to find this software is:  "You are downloading *" "you are downloader number * of this file" </Comment>

<Query>filetype:cgi inurl:cachemgr.cgi</Query>
<Comment>cachemgr.cgi is a management interface for the Squid proxy service. It was installed by default in /cgi-bin by RedHat Linux 5.2 and 6.0 installed with Squid. This script prompts for a host and port which it then attempts to connect to. If a web server, such as apache, is running this can be used to connect to arbitrary hosts and ports, allowing for potential use as an intermediary in denial of service attacks, proxied port scans, etc. Interpreting the output of the script can allow the attacker to determine whether or not a connection was established. </Comment>

<Comment>vAuthenticate is a multi-platform compatible PHP and MySQL script which allows creation of new user accounts new user groups, activate/inactivate groups or individual accounts, set user level, etc.  There are two admin users by default with an easy to guess password. The backup admin user can *not* be deleted. There is also a test account with the same password that can not be deleted.  An attacker can find the default passwords by downloading the software and browsing the .sql files. Default passwords are seldom changed if the user is not *forced* to change them first before using the sofware. This software doesn't enforce such a rule.</Comment>

<Comment>This brings up alot of insecure as well as secure filemanagers. These software solutions are often used by companies offering a "simple" but "cost effective" way to their users who don't know unix or html. There is a problem sometimes with this specific filemanager due to insecure use of the session ID that can be found in the unprotected "fileman.log" logfile.  It has been reported that an attacker can abuse the last document-edit-url of the logfile. By copy pasting that line in a new window it gives the attacker valid user credentials on the server, at least for a while.. (think hours not seconds).</Comment>

<Comment>http://www.cirt.net/advisories/ew_file_manager.shtml: Product: EasyWeb FileManager Module - http://home.postnuke.ru/index.php  Description: EasyWeb FileManager Module for PostNuke is vulnerable to a directory traversal problem which allows retrieval of arbitrary files from the remote system. Systems Affected: EasyWeb FileManager 1.0 RC-1  Technical Description: The PostNuke module works by loading a directory and/or file via the "pathext" (directory) and "view" (file) variables. Providing a relative path (from the document repository) in the "pathext" variable will cause FileManager to provide a directory listing of that diretory. Selecting a file in that listing, or putting a file name in the "view" variable, will cause EasyWeb to load the file specified. Only files and directories which can be read by the system user running PHP can be retrieved.  Assuming PostNuke is installed at the root level: /etc directory listing: /index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc  /etc/passwd file: /index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc/&amp;view=passwd  Fix/Workaround: Use another file manager module for PostNuke, as the authors do not appear to be maintaining EW FileManager.  Vendor Status: Vendor was contacted but did not respond. Credir: Sullo - cirt.net  NOTE: mitigating factor, an attacker needs to be registred and logged on to have access rights to this module.</Comment>

<Query>intitle:"Welcome to IIS 4.0"</Query>
<Comment>Moving from personal, lightweight web servers into more production-ready software, we find that even administrators of Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) sometimes don't have a clue what they're doing. By searching on web pages with titles of "Welcome to IIS 4.0" we find that even if they've taken the time to change their main page, some dorks forget to change the titles of their default-installed web pages. This is an indicator that their web server is most likely running, or was upgraded from, the now considered OLD IIS 4.0 and that at least portions of their main pages are still exactly the same as they were out of the box. Conclusion? The rest of the factory-installed stuff is most likely lingering around on these servers as well. Old code: FREE with operating system. Poor content management: an average of $40/hour.  Factory-installed default scripts: FREE with operating system. Getting hacked by a script kiddie that found you on Google: PRICELESS.  For all the things money can't buy, there's a googleDork award.</Comment>

<Comment> "Open WebMail is a webmail system based on the Neomail version 1.14 from Ernie Miller. Open WebMail is designed to manage very large mail folder files in a memory efficient way. It also provides a range of features to help users migrate smoothly from Microsoft Outlook to Open WebMail". A remote attacker can run arbitrary commands with the web server's privileges by exploiting an unfiltered parameter in userstat.pl.    Details   Vulnerable Systems:   * Open Webmail versions 2.20, 2.21 and 2.30   * Limited exploitation on openwebmail-current.tgz that was released on 2004-04-30 (See below)     The vulnerability was discovered in an obsolete script named userstat.pl shipped with Open Webmail. The script doesn't properly filter out shell characters from the loginname parameter. The loginname parameter is used as an argument when executing openwebmail-tool.pl from the vulnerable script. By adding a ";", "|" or "( )" followed by the shell command to a http GET, HEAD or POST request an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands as an unprivileged user (the Apache user, "nobody" or "www", e.g.).     </Comment>
